A hands-on computer vision project to control a Tello drone in real-time. I implemented two main features using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and the **djitellopy** library.

* **Point-and-Click Flying:** Allows the user to click anywhere in the drone's video feed, and the drone calculates the error and flies to that position.
* **ArUco Marker Tracking:** The drone automatically detects and follows a specific ArUco marker, using a proportional controller to adjust its speed and centering.
